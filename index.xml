      <description>Hello! Before going any further, please take a look at the ABOUT section to learn a bit about me!

This site is hosted on GitHub pages and I directly push code and updates through there. Super easy if you want to build something fast and clean.</description>

 Learned how to develop, deploy, and manage a full-stack iOS application w/ a super fun and collaborative AGILE team Became one of those annoying Vim people (sorry VSCode) Received all certifications in a major SIEM - shoutout Sumo Logic!</description>
